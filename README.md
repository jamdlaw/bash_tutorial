tutorial step by step

download the files from git hub

you will find Three folders 
	Start - containes the files in there begining state, before we change them toughout the tutorial 
        Mine - this is an empty folder which we are going to fill with the file from Start 
	Finshed - is a folder that shows the finished files from competing the tutrials 

After we have cloned the repo we need to use our first command to copy all the files from the Start folder to the Mine folder
```
cp -R Start/ Mine/ 
```

cp is the bash command for copy, we are using -r to recusivly copy all of the folders and file. Next we specify the folder we are copying from, and finally the folder we want to copy into.
